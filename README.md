This repository hosts the project developed in the Agents and Distributed Artificial Intelligence class, a fourth year course that aims to give students an introduction to intelligent multiagent systems.

In this project, we implement a multiagent system that simulated a civil protection system, where different stations had to send ambulances, police and firefighters, according to the citizens emergencies.
